# Next

## [10.0.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/10.0.0)

### Added

* `Section.isEmpty` property indicating that section does not contain any elements. Accessing this property is faster than accessing `Section.numberOfItems` property.

## [10.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/10.0.0-beta.1)

### Removed

* `defersDatasourceUpdates` on `MemoryStorage`. This property was deprecated in previous release and is now removed. `MemoryStorage` now always defers updates as if this property was turned on (which was the default).
* `ProxyDiffableDataSourceStorage`. Diffable datasource integration has been restructured in a way, that no longer requires this class.

## [9.1.2](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/9.1.2)

### Added

* Ability to create `SectionModel` with array of items.

## [9.1.1](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/9.1.1)

### Fixed

* Xcode 12.5 / Swift 5.4 warnings

## [9.1.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/9.1.0)

### Changed

* UICollectionView cell and supplementary registration from code and xib has been updated to only create `UICollectionView.CellRegistration` and `UICollectionView.SupplementaryRegistration` once per mapping. This is required for proper cell and supplementary reuse.

## [9.0.1](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/9.0.1)

### Changed

* Realm subspec has been reenabled.

## [9.0.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/9.0.0)

### Changed

* DTModelStorage/Realm CocoaPods subspec requires Realm 10.0 and higher.

## [9.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/9.0.0-beta.1)

### Added

* `ViewModelMapping.modelCondition` method, that allows to create custom mapping condition, but infers model type from mapping. Behavior of this method is identical to `ModelTransfer.modelCondition` method, except that new method does not require cell or view to implement `ModelTransfer` protocol.
* `MemoryStorage.insertItems(_:at:)` method, that allows inserting collection starting from provided indexPath. This is useful, for example, if you are using pagination, and want to insert new page of items between old pages and loading indicator.

### Changed

This release requires Swift 5.3.

Some context: this release heavily relies on where clauses on contextually generic declarations, that are only available in Swift 5.3 - [SE-0267](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0267-where-on-contextually-generic.md).

* DTModelStorage/Realm subspec requires RealmSwift 5.2 and higher for minimum iOS 9 deployment target.

### Breaking

* `ViewModelMapping` has been reworked to generic class to capture both View and Model type.
* `ViewModelMappingProtocol` protocol has been introduced to represent type-erased interface for `ViewModelMapping` so that `ViewModelMappingProtocol` instances can be stored in array, and be called without generic information.
* `EventReaction` class has been reworked to not contain `ViewModelMapping` instance. `ViewModelMapping` class will now instead have an array of `EventReaction` instances attached to it. This way it's now possible to restrict events to only happen if current `ViewModelMapping` is compatible for requested model/view/location/mapping condition.
* `ViewModelMapping` convenience methods `eventsModelMapping` and `eventsViewMapping` have been removed.
* `mappingCandidates` method now returns `ViewModelMappingProtocol` instead of `ViewModelMapping`
* `performReaction` methods now accept `IndexPath` for `location` parameter instead of `Any`.
* Event reactions are moved from extension on `[ViewModelMapping]` to static methods on `EventReaction` due to Swift inability to call methods on sequences that contain protocols.
* `mappingCandidates` method has been moved to `ViewType` type.
* `EventReaction` has new initializers with more specific names.
* `insertItems(_:to:)` method is no longer throwing. Anomaly is still produced, if count of models differs from count of indexPaths.

### Deprecated

* `MemoryStorage.defersDatasourceUpdates` property. Deferring datasource updates and executing them inside of performBatchUpdates block turned out to be the only stable and correct way to apply updates to both UI and datasource. It's highly recommended to leave this property on. It is now deprecated, and may be removed in the future release, maintaining current default behaviour.
* `SectionModel.setItems(_:)` method. Set items directly through `items` property.

## [8.1.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/8.1.0)

### Changed

* Deployment targets - iOS 11 / tvOS 11.
* Minimum Swift version required: 5.0
* Realm dependency updated to Realm 5.

Please note, that this framework version source is identical to previous version (apart from some small Realm adjustments), which supports iOS 8 / tvOS 9 / Swift 4.0 and higher.

## [8.0.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/8.0.0)

## [8.0.0-beta.2](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/8.0.0-beta.2)

* Added support for Xcode versions, that are older than Xcode 11.

## [8.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/8.0.0-beta.1)

**This is a major release with some breaking changes, please read [DTModelStorage 8.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/blob/master/Guides/8.0%20Migration%20Guide.md)**

### Added

* `bundle` property on `ViewModelMapping`, that exposes recommended bundle to be used when searching for resources of given mapping.
* Setter for `SingleSectionStorage.items` property.
* `Section.item(at:)` method.
* `ProxyDiffableDataSourceStorage` that serves as a bridge between `DTTableViewManager`/`DTCollectionViewManager` and diffable datasource classes(`UITableViewDiffableDataSource`\`UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource`).

### Changed

* `configureForTableViewUsage`, `configureForCollectionViewUsage`, `headerModel(forSection:)`, `footerModel(forSection:)`, have been moved to protocol extensions instead of being implemented in `BaseStorage` class. As a consequence, `BaseStorage` no longer confirms to HeaderFooterStorage protocol.

### Breaking

`Identifiable` protocol has been renamed to `EntityIdentifiable` protocol to avoid unwanted clashes with `Foundation.Identifiable` protocol, that is available on iOS 13 and higher.

Complete rewrite of header/footer/supplementary model handling. Instead of several implementations and model storages, the API now consists of three closure based properties on `SupplementaryStorage` protocol : `headerModelProvider`, `footerModelProvider` and `supplementaryModelProvider`. All storage classes implement this protocol (`MemoryStorage`, `CoreDataStorage`, `RealmStorage`, `SingleSectionStorage`, `ProxyDiffableDataSourceStorage`).

Storage protocols and classes have been restructured:

* `SupplementaryAccessible` renamed to `SectionLocatable`
* `HeaderFooterStorage`  and `HeaderFooterSettable` have been removed
* `HeaderFooterStorage` functionality mostly has been merged into new protocol `SupplementaryStorage`
* `BaseStorage` has been split into `BaseSupplementaryStorage` and `BaseUpdateDeliveringStorage` that inherits from it.

Several methods continue to work, but are now bridging to new closure-based API:

* `setSectionHeaderModels`
* `setSectionFooterModels`
* `headerModel(forSection:)`
* `footerModel(forSection:)`
* `supplementaryModel(ofKind:forSectionAt:)`

`setSectionHeaderModels` and `setSectionFooterModels`, as well as new closure-based API **do not call reloadData method, as they were doing before**. If you need to reset section headers/footers/supplementaries, consider calling `StorageUpdating.storageNeedsReloading()` method manually.

All methods that allowed to set header/footer/supplementary models partially, for a specific section or specific supplementary kind, have been made unavailable or removed.

`CoreDataStorage` now sets `headerModelProvider` closure to allow using FetchedResultsController section name as header instead of having arbitrary logic that compared supplementaryKind to `displaySectionNameForSupplementaryKinds` property, which is also made unavailable.

### Removed

* Deprecated `MemoryStorageError.BatchInsertionReason` enum.
* Deprecated `ViewModelMappingCustomizing` protocol.
* `sections` method on `Storage` protocol. It is replaced by more perfomant `numberOfSections()` and `numberOfItems(inSection:)` methods.
* `sections` method on `CoreDataStorage` and `SingleSectionStorage`
* `items` property on `Section` protocol. It is replaced by `item(at:)` method.

## [7.4.1](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/7.4.1)

### Fixed

* `setItemsForAllSections` method now properly removes all sections prior to setting new ones. This prevents a bug, where old sections could stay, if this method was called with fewer number of sections.

## [7.4.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/7.4.0)

### Added

* Support for Swift Package Manager in Xcode 11

### Changed

* Slightly improved RealmStorage `item(at:)` method perfomance.
* Improved StorageUpdate description.
* `ViewModelMapping.xibName` can now be changed inside of mapping blocks to allow changing xibName per mapping.

## [7.3.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/7.3.0)

### Added

* Support for Swift 5 and Xcode 10.2

### Deprecated

* `ViewModelMappingCustomizing` protocol. Please switch to using mapping conditions instead.

### Removed

* Support for Xcode 9 and Swift 3

## [7.2.1](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/7.2.1)

* Make `enqueueDatasourceUpdate` method and `enqueuedDatasourceUpdates` property public to allow building custom storages that defer datasource updates.

## [7.2.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/7.2.0)

### Added

* Single section storage classes that encapsulate single section of models with automatic diffing to animate changes. For a lot of use cases this approach is more suitable than `MemoryStorage` and is now a recommended way of handling items in single section.

Read more about it [in README](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage#singlesectionstorage).

* Convenience method to create `MappingCondition` from ModelTransfer objects, for example, if used with `DTTableViewManager`:

```swift
manager.register(PostCell.self) { mapping in
  mapping.condition = PostCell.modelCondition { indexPath, model in
    return model.isMyPost // here model type is inferred from PostCell ModelTransfer implementation
  }
}
```
* Ability to silence anomalies, if they are expected:

```swift
memoryStorage.anomalyHandler.silenceAnomaly(.moveItemFailedItemNotFound(indexPath: IndexPath(section: 0, row: 0)))
```

Alternatively, you may want to silence anomaly using closure, if anomaly contents are only calculatable at runtime:

```swift
memoryStorage.anomalyHandler.silenceAnomaly { anomaly in
    switch anomaly {
    case .replaceItemFailedItemNotFound: return true
    default: return false
    }
}
```

* Support for Swift 4.2 and Xcode 10.

## [7.1.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/7.1.0)

### Added

* Anomaly detecting system for various errors in `MemoryStorage`.  Read more about it in [DTTableViewManager Anomaly Handler Readme section](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTTableViewManager#anomaly-handler). Anomaly handler system **requires Swift 4.1 and higher**.

### Changed

* Support for Xcode 10 (beta 1) with Swift 4.1 and Swift 4.2.

### Fixed

* Crash that could happen if move operation for `MemoryStorage` happened from and to the same section with not enough items in section.

## [7.0.3](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/7.0.3)

* Updates for Xcode 9.3 and Swift 4.1

## [7.0.2](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/7.0.2)

* Properly collect all updates from updateWithoutAnimations block.

## [7.0.1](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/7.0.1)

* Fixed a bug, that prevented datasource from being updated when `updateWithoutAnimations` method on `MemoryStorage` was used.

## [7.0.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/7.0.0)

## [7.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/7.0.0-beta.1)

* Implemented mechanism for deferring datasource updates of `MemoryStorage`.  When turned on, updates are no longer applied automatically, but can be applied calling `StorageUpdate.applyDeferredDatasourceUpdates()` method. Keep in mind, that not only datasource updates are not applied, but object and section changes are also empty until updates are applied. This behaviour is turned on by default, to disable it, call

```swift
MemoryStorage.defersDatasourceUpdates = false
```

* Ream podspec now requires `Realm` version 3.x

## [6.0.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/6.0.0)

* Fixed warnings for Xcode 9.1 / Swift 4.0.2

## [6.0.0-beta.2](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/6.0.0-beta.2)

* Build with Xcode 9.0 release.

## [6.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/6.0.0-beta.1)

**This is major release, containing breaking API changes, please read [DTTableViewManager 6.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTTableViewManager/blob/master/Documentation/DTTableViewManager%206.0%20Migration%20Guide.md)**

* `MemoryStorage` now has a convenience method for moving item without animations: `moveItemWithoutAnimation(from:to:)`.
* `EventReaction` class now has 4 and 5 argument reactions
* All storage protocols are now class-bound.
* Implemented mapping conditions. `ViewModelMapping` was changed to be able to work with mapping blocks.

# Breaking

* `RealmStorage` is not included in Carthage releases.
* `setItems` method, that accepted array of arrays of items to set items for all sections, has been renamed to `setItemsForAllSections` to provide more clarity and not to clash with `setItems(_:forSection:)` method.

## [5.1.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/5.1.0)

* Swift 3.2 support(Xcode 9 beta 1).
* `RealmStorage` now accepts `RealmCollection` objects into section, thus allowing `List` and `LinkingObjects` to be used(previously only `Results` objects could be used in section).

## [5.0.1](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/5.0.1)

* Improved handling of `NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate` `NSFetchedResultsChangeType.update` change type in cases, where object inserts/removal/moves is used simultaneously with object updates(#17).

## [5.0.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/5.0.0)

* Reworked `EventReaction` class to use `ViewModelMapping` to properly identify not only model and `ViewType`, but also `viewClass`. This allows event reactions to run for cases where two view subclasses, conforming to `ModelTransfer`, use the same model, and have similar events.

## [4.1.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/4.1.0)

* Adds `setItems(_:)` method, that allows to set items for all sections in `MemoryStorage`.

## [4.0.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/4.0.0)

* `StorageUpdate` properties, that tracked changes independently of each other, have been replaced with `objectChanges`, `sectionChanges` arrays, that track all changes in order they occured
* `StorageUpdate` now has `updatedObjects` dictionary, that allow tracking objects, that have been updated, along with corresponding indexPath. It is done because UITableView and UICollectionView defer cell updates after insertions and deletions are completed, and therefore shift indexPaths. For example, if you were to insert 0 item and update it, UITableView would think that you are updating 1 item instead of 0, because it happens in single animation block and 0 item becomes 1.

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/3.0.0)

No changes

## [3.0.0-beta.3](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/3.0.0-beta.3)

* Requires Realm 2.0 and higher.
* Fixes crash, that happens, when subscribing to Realm notifications and Realm is read-only.

## [3.0.0-beta.2](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/3.0.0-beta.2)

* Enables `RealmStorage` with `RealmSwift` dependency

## [3.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/3.0.0-beta.1)

Swift 3.0 and higher is required for this version of framework.

**Note** Beta 1 Does not include RealmStorage subspec due to [RealmSwift.framework podspec issues](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues/4101)

### Reworked

* `UIReaction` class has been replaced with new `EventReaction` class, that allows more flexible and powerful events usage
* Supplementary models are now stored in `[String:[Int:Any]]` instead of `[String:Any]` to support supplementary models, whose position is determined by indexPath in UICollectionView. `SupplementaryStorageProtocol`, `SupplementaryAccessible` protocols have been reworked to reflect those changes.
* `MemoryStorageErrors` have been made an `Error` type following conventions from [SE-0112](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0112-nserror-bridging.md).

### Added

* `MemoryStorage` and `RealmStorage` now implement  `SectionLocationIdentifyable` protocol, allowing any section to find out, what it's index is.
* `SectionModel` and `RealmSection` gained `currentSectionIndex` property, that shows index of section in sections array.
* `displaySectionNameForSupplementaryKinds` property on `CoreDataStorage`, that defines, for which supplementary kinds `NSFetchedResultsController` `sectionName` should be used as a data model.
* `removeItemsFromSection` method on `MemoryStorage`, that allows to remove all items from specific section

### Removed

* `itemForCellClass:atIndexPath:`, `itemForHeaderClass:atSectionIndex:`, `itemsForFooterClass:atSectionIndex:`
* `makeNSIndexSet` method, because Swift 3 allows to directly create IndexSet from both `Array` and `Set`.

## [2.6.2](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/2.6.2)

### Fixed

* `CoreDataStorage` now properly updates new indexPath after Move event on iOS 9.

## [2.6.1](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/2.6.1)

### Fixed

* Now properly handles case, when `deleteSections` method was called with index, that is not present in `MemoryStorage` or `RealmStorage`

### Added

* `setSectionWithResults(_:forSectionIndex:)` for `RealmStorage`

### Updated

* `Realm` dependency to `1.0.0`

## [2.6.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/2.6.0)

### Changed

* Support for fine-grained notifications in Realm
* Update to Realm 0.103.1 and higher.

### Fixed

* Fixed https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTTableViewManager/issues/34, thanks @orkenstein, @andrewSvsg

## [2.5.1](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/2.5.1)

## Changed

* Realm dependency updated to 0.102 version.

## [2.5.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/2.5.0)

## Breaking

* Update to Swift 2.2. This release is not backwards compatible with Swift 2.1.

## Added

* `insertItems(_:toIndexPaths:)` method, that mirrors UITableView `insertRowsAtIndexPaths(_:withRowAnimation:)` and UICollectionView `insertItemsAtIndexPaths(_:)` method
* `totalNumberOfItems` computed property in `MemoryStorage`, that allows getting current total number of items across all storage.

## Changed

* Require Only-App-Extension-Safe API is set to YES in framework targets.

## [2.4.4](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/2.4.4)

### Changed

* `batchUpdatesInProgress` property on `BaseStorage` is made public to be available in subclasses

## [2.4.3](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/2.4.3)

### Changed

* All methods were moved from extensions to class bodies to allow overriding them in @nonobjc subclasses.

## [2.4.2](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/2.4.2)

### Changed

* `replaceItem(_:replacingItem:)` method no longer requires second argument to be Equatable.

## [2.4.1](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/2.4.1)

### Changed

* `BaseStorage` `startUpdate` and `finishUpdate` methods are now public along with `currentUpdate` property.

## [2.4.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/2.4.0)

### Added

* `RealmStorage` and `RealmSection` class, that allows using Realm database results as a storage for `DTTableView` and `DTCollectionViewManager`.
* Ability to specify xibName on `ViewModelMapping` class.

### Removed

Removed API, deprecated in previous releases. All removed API calls are superseded by following replacement methods.

* `removeAllTableItems`, `removeAllCollectionItems` -> `removeAllItems`
* `moveCollectionItemAtIndexPath:toIndexPath:`, `moveTableItemAtIndexPath:toIndexPath:` -> `moveItemAtIndexPath:toIndexPath:`
* `moveCollectionViewSection:toSection`, `moveTableViewSection:toSection` -> `moveSection:toSection`
* `objectForCellClass` -> `itemForCellClass`
* `objectForHeaderClass` -> `itemForHeaderClass`
* `objectForFooterClass` -> `itemForFooterClass`
* `objectAtIndexPath` -> `itemAtIndexPath`
* `SectionModel` `objects` and `numberOfObjects` -> `items`, `numberOfItems`

## [2.3.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/2.3.0)

### Added

* `ViewModelMapping` class, that allows to store and retrieve mappings using type checks instead of runtime introspection
* `UIReaction` class, that will allow `DTTableViewManager` and `DTCollectionViewManager` to react to selection and configuration events. This class supersedes `TableViewReaction` and `CollectionViewReaction` internal classes, that previously served the same purpose.
* `DTViewModelMappingCustomizable` protocol to allow customization of `ViewModelMapping`.

### Removed

* `RuntimeHelper` model introspection methods

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/2.2.0)

### Added

* `performUpdates` method to perform batch updates on Storage classes.
* Support for Apple TV platform (tvOS)

### Fixed

* Handle NSFetchedResultsController update, that may be called in a form of .Move type(iOS 9).

## [2.1.3](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/2.1.3)

### Fixed

* `insertItem(_:atIndexPath:)` method now properly accepts zero index path in empty section

## [2.1.2](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/2.1.2)

### Added

* `setSection(_:forSectionIndex:)` method to set specific section with supplementaries and reloadData

### Updated

* Explicitly call storageNeedsReloading from methods `setSupplementaries`, `setSectionHeaderModels` and `setSectionFooterModels`

## [2.1.1](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/2.1.1)

#### Added
* `insertSection(_:atIndex:)` method that allows to insert `SectionModel` directly, with items and supplementary models.

## [2.1.0](https://github.com/DenTelezhkin/DTModelStorage/releases/tag/2.1.0)

#### Updated
* `StorageUpdate` class was rewritten from scratch using Swift Set.
* `StorageUpdate` now contains movedRowIndexPaths and movedSectionIndexes properties
* All method names and properties, that contained `object` term in their name, have been renamed to read 'item' instead
* `MemoryStorage` `sectionAtIndex(_:)` method now returns optional value instead of always returning `SectionModel`. This method no longer inserts new sections, when called.

#### Fixed
* `removeItems` method should no longer skip items, if their indexPath is reduced when removing previous item

#### Removed
* `removeAllTableItems` and `removeAllCollectionItems` have been replaced by `removeAllItems` method.
* `moveCollectionItemAtIndexPath:toIndexPath:` and `moveTableItemAtIndexPath:toIndexPath:` have been replaced by `moveItemAtIndexPath:toIndexPath:` method
